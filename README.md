# pyVipr

4D flow MRI processing in python

# Motivation

* Increase accessibility (removing need for Matlab or compiled Matlab code)
* Better UI capabilities via Qt6
* Better multithreading capabilities for intensive IO bound operations
* Increase maintainability via refactoring towards OOP which Python natively handles better than Matlab
* Allow non-UI use to perform preprocessing. Perfect for automated pipelines and thereby reduce user time in the UI.
